EuropeanaLicensingFramework
===========================

The Europeana Licensing Framework that is being developed by Kennisland and Europeana

Kennisland
----------

Kennisland develops solutions for the issues that crop up during the transformation to a knowledge society, and it plays a pioneering role in this process. We are continuously asking ourselves how to achieve this: how to build the knowledge society that we have in mind. Developing interventions helps us to learn how to proceed. We share the knowledge that we gain with as many people as possible, because knowledge is only of value when it is shared.

Europeana
---------

Europeana.eu is an internet portal that acts as an interface to millions of books, paintings, films, museum objects and archival records that have been digitised throughout Europe. Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci, Girl with a Pearl Earring by Johannes Vermeer, the works of Charles Darwin and Isaac Newton and the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart are some of the highlights on Europeana.
