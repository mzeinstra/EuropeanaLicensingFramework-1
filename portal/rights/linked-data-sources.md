#Europeana Data Sources

Europeana collects data relating to digital objects held by galleries, libraries, archives and museums across Europe (the &lsquo;Europeana data providers&rsquo;). The descriptive metadata provided by these institutions are provided to Europeana under terms that allow Europeana to aggregate it, to enrich it and to publish resulting data under the terms of the [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ "Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication information"). If you re-use data published by Europeana, we encourage you to follow the [Europeana Usage Guidelines for Metadata](metadata-usage-guidelines.html "Click here to view the Europeana Usage Guidelines for Metadata") and to provide attribution to the data sources including, where possible, links to the digital objects on the original data providers' websites.

In addition to our data providers, who supply object-related data, Europeana uses a number of other sources to enrich data. Europeana wishes to express thanks to the contributors of these projects who enable us to improve the quality of our data. Please find below a list of data sources used by Europeana:
