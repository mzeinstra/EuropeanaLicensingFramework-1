#Europeana and the Public Domain

A large part of the content currently accessible via Europeana consists of pre-20th century works. Most of these works are no longer protected by copyright and are in the public domain. Part of Europeana's mission is to ensure that works that are in the public domain are made available without restrictions. With this, Europeana strives to help both users and providers to understand the public domain and to ensure that it continues to function in the technological environment of the networked information society. This approach is not intended to prevent organisations from commercially exploiting public domain works that they have in their collections. Instead, it provides a set of minimum standards, ensuring that the public domain functions in the digital environment.';

As a result of this mission, the Europeana _Data Exchange Agreement _requires that data providers label works that are in the public domain as being in the public domain by applying the Public Domain Mark.

Europeana is aware that many cultural heritage institutions desire recognition for their considerable efforts in preserving and digitising public domain works and making them available. However, Europeana also believes that claiming copyright in digital reproductions of public domain works is the wrong strategy to realise this. To promote responsible re-use of public domain works (including attribution for institutions that have invested in processing them), Europeana has developed its [Usage Guidelines for Public Domain Works](http://www.europeana.eu/portal/rights/pd-usage-guide.html). All public domain works in Europeana have a link to the _Usage Guidelines_ alongside them.

Europeana has worked with Creative Commons to develop a simple mark that indicates that a work is in the public domain - [the Public Domain Mark](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/). Works that are labelled as being in the public domain can be re-used by anyone without any restrictions. Rights information icons are displayed alongside search results. It is, therefore, important that this information is provided and is correct.

For further information about Europeana's position on the public domain please consult the [Europeana Public Domain Charter](http://www.europeana.eu/portal/rights/public-domain-charter.html) and the [New Renaissance](http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/digital_libraries/doc/refgroup/final_report_cds.pdf) report.

##How to establish if a work is in the public domain

Determining whether a work is in the public domain or is still protected by copyright can be a complicated process. For this purpose, Kennisland, the Institute for Information Law, and the National Library of Luxembourg have developed a set of public domain calculators. These calculators can be found at [www.outofcopyright.eu](http://www.outofcopyright.eu).

##What is the difference between the Public Domain Mark and the CC0 Public Domain Dedication?

It is very important not to confuse these two rights statements. It will often be the case that cultural heritage digital objects submitted to Europeana will be in the public domain and must be marked accordingly by using the Public Domain Mark. CC0 is specifically designed for use with (meta) data sets and is unlikely to be used as a rights statement describing content. In the context of Europeana, CC0 is primarily used to ensure that metadata can be used without any restrictions. The CC0 waiver is automatically applied to all metadata that is being provided to Europeana.

The Public Domain Mark (PDM):

* Applies to objects that are not subject to copyright either because copyright has expired (e.g. the author died many years ago) or because the object was never subject to such rights and is therefore in the public domain.
* Anyone can apply the PDM to an object if they know the object is in the public domain.'; 

The Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication:

* Can be applied to objects or data that is subject to copyright but where the rights holder wants to waive the rights and dedicate the object to the public domain.
* It can only be applied by the rights holder or someone who is authorised by the rights holder. 

For more information on how to apply these rights statements, please consult the [Available Rights Statements](http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/available-rights-statements) section.
