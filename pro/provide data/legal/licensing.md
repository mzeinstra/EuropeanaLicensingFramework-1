#Legal Requirements for Providing Data

Data providers and aggregators provide Europeana with metadata, a thumbnail and a link pointing to a digital object on the provider's website. The terms regarding data delivery and re-use are governed by Europeana's _Data Exchange Agreement_. You can download the _Data Exchange Agreement_ and _Europeana Licensing Framework_ from our [Publications page](http://pro.europeana.eu/publications). This framework governs Europeana's relationship with the data providers and aggregators, and sets out conditions for data re-use. [More information on data re-use](http://pro.europeana.eu/re-use-data).

##Data Exchange Agreement

The [Data Exchange Agreement ](http://pro.europeana.eu/data-exchange-agreement)_establishes two main rules relating to the intellectual property rights (IPR) in the metadata and content delivered to Europeana:

1.  All metadata provided to Europeana will be published by Europeana as [open data](http://pro.europeana.eu/linked-open-data) under the terms of the Creative Commons Zero Public Domain Dedication (CC0).
2.  Each digital object (and the associated preview) that is available via Europeana needs to carry a rights label that describes its copyright status (see 'Rights Labelling' below). If an object is in the public domain, it must be labelled as being in the public domain. 

For more information, read about [the difference between 'metadata' and 'content'](http://pro.europeana.eu/content-and-metadata) and [Europeana and the public domain](http://pro.europeana.eu/public-domain-content).

##Rights Labelling

When providing data about digital objects to Europeana, data providers are asked to provide rights information. The rights information about a digital object is recorded in the 'edm:rights' field and communicated to users whenever data related to the object is displayed or otherwise made available.

Given Europeana's focus on enabling re-use of Europeana content, it is extremely important that the rights information communicated via 'edm:rights' is as accurate as possible (users of the Europeana API need to be able to rely on the rights information when using the API for applications and services). In addition, Europeana uses the 'edm:rights' information to indicate the rights status of previews to end-users. 'Edm:rights' is a mandatory field - it needs to be filled in for each object that is made available via Europeana.

The following pages provide information about how to provide rights information via the 'edm:rights' field and give an overview of the available rights statements.

###Available rights statements

We have provided [an overview of all rights statements ](http://pro.europeana.eu/available-rights-statements)supported by the 'edm:rights' field. On this page, you will also find short descriptions of each rights statement as well as links to examples on Europeana.

##Public Domain Calculators

 In order to provide adequate rights information to Europeana, data providers need to know whether the works that they are providing are covered by copyright or if the copyright has expired and the work is in the public domain. To help, Europeana has developed public domain calculators for 30 European jurisdictions. The public domain calculators can be found at [www.outofcopyright.eu](http://www.outofcopyright.eu)
