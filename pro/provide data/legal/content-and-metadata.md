#The difference between 'content' and 'metadata'

It is important to understand that the _Europeana Licensing Framework_ does not affect the rights of the objects in the collections of contributing institutions. Europeana maintains a database that contains only previews and descriptive information about the objects held by the contributing institutions.

The descriptive information about these objects is called metadata. For a better understanding of the difference between 'content and metadata', it is useful to think of the object and its information separated out into four layers:

1. Consider the first layer as containing the (physical) objects held by the contributing organisations. These can be paintings, archaeological artefacts, books, archival documents, photos, videos, sound recordings or any other type of object that is held by a cultural heritage or scientific organisation.

2. The second layer contains digital objects representing these physical objects. These can be photographs, scans, transcriptions, models, videos, audio recordings or any other type of digital file that represents a physical object. There can be multiple digital objects relating to one physical object. Europeana collects information about digital objects that are made available online by its data providers.

3. The third layer contains the previews that illustrate search results on Europeana. Europeana creates these previews for the purpose of making the objects visible and therefore discoverable on Europeana. These previews can be smaller versions of digital image files, snippets from audio and/or video files, excerpts from text files or other reduced-quality representations of the digital objects held by the contributing institutions.

4. In the fourth layer, Europeana collects descriptive metadata about the digital objects from its providers. This descriptive metadata contains only information about the digital and physical object and includes factual information such as titles, authors and dates as well as descriptions and relationships to other objects.

In the context of the _Europeana Licensing Framework_, layers one, two and three are considered 'content', and layer four is 'metadata'.

The _Europeana Licensing Framework_ does not affect the rights in the content. The rights to the content made available via Europeana remain under the control of the data providers who make these objects available. Data providers use the 'edm:rights' field to communicate the rights status of content (see [an overview of all available rights statements](http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/available-rights-statements)).

The _Europeana Licensing Framework_ ensures that all metadata collected by Europeana can be published under the terms of the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication (CC0). This does not apply to the content (including previews).
